I made this modification in a free time. Turned out people like it so I decided to release it for everyone.

Would you kindly go to a [screenshots page](Screenshots.md) so I won't have to type a witty description here? ;p

[You can also see it in action on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/NoArmsIrene/videos), thanks to NoArmsIrene.

## Features ##
  * Almost every element has been enhanced in some way for clarity, but I tried to make it interesting at the same time.
  * Two working modes switchable with cl\_hud\_minmode 0/1. One designed for normal play and the other for competitive players. Head to screenshots pages for details:
    1. [cl\_hud\_minmode 0](Screenshots.md)
    1. [cl\_hud\_minmode 1](Screenshots_minmode.md)
  * Support for the following aspect ratios: 16:9, 16:10, 4:3, 5:3.
  * Works with a mac and a linux version of the game.
